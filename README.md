libSPE
======

This file provides a way of reading and parsing proprietary data format SPE generated by certain spectrometers.

A graphical user interface is also available with SPE_Analyser where you can subtract the data for the background and measure the values of specific lines. This was useful for a particular project and was not designed to be universal for everyone. Please feel free to reuse the code and adapt it for your own usage.
